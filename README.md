# Welcome!
## Plans for this 
- Include grammar points I find on reddit and other forum posting websites that I think would be good to spread around
- Maintain this regularly since there is a lot of Korean grammar I am not good at LMAO.

#[~(으)ㄹ거예요 vs ~(으)ㄹ게요.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/tzvtyf/comment/i41tygp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

The way I understand it is that -(으)ㄹ 거예요 is something that has already been decided outside the context of the current conversation - it is a fixed plan that you had already made. -(으)ㄹ게요 is used when you make a plan because of new information in the context of a conversation.

A: "오늘 뭐 해요?" - What will you do today?

B: "등산 할거예요" - I will go hiking. (This plan was already made)

vs.

A:"전화기 울리고 있어요" - The phone is ringing.

B: "제가 받을게요" - I'll answer it. (This is a new plan based on A's new information"

In response to "순두부찌개 먹어본 적 있어요?" I wouldn't use either of the two options you provided. I would probably say something like "안 먹어 봤는데 오늘 먹으려고 해요."
