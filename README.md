 The way I understand it is that -(으)ㄹ 거예요 is something that has already been decided outside the context of the current conversation - it is a fixed plan that you had already made. -(으)ㄹ게요 is used when you make a plan because of new information in the context of a conversation.

>A: "오늘 뭐 해요?" - What will you do today?
>
>B: "등산 할거예요" - I will go hiking. (This plan was already made)

vs.

>A:"전화기 울리고 있어요" - The phone is ringing.
>
>B: "제가 받을게요" - I'll answer it. (This is a new plan based on A's new information"

 In response to "순두부찌개 먹어본 적 있어요?" I wouldn't use either of the two options you provided. I would probably say something like "안 먹어 봤는데 오늘 먹으려고 해요."

# ~지 않다, ~지 못하다, ~(으)ㄹ 없다. 
[link](https://korean.stackexchange.com/questions/181/what-is-the-difference-between-%EC%A7%80-%EC%95%8A%EB%8B%A4-%EC%A7%80-%EB%AA%BB%ED%95%98%EB%8B%A4-and-%E3%84%B9-%EC%9D%84-%EC%88%98-%EC%97%86%EB%8B%A4)
## General Rules
### ~지 않다(also 안 하다)
- On a 동사(action verb)
    - One doesn't do something, regardless of whether it's possible or not
    - Very often implies (with strength of the implication depending on the context) *deliberately* not doing something. But it doesn't automatically confer actually deliberateness in all cases
    > 저는 가지 않았어요 --> "I didn't go"
- On a 형용사(adjective)
    - One *isn't* something, again regardless of whether it is possible *to* be.
    > 저는 똑똑하지 않아요. --> "I am not smart"

### ~지 못하다(also 못 하다)
- One can't do/be something
- Does not imply that the action is *impossible*, rather, it implies that the action couldn't be done perhaps due to circumstances, but may otherwise be possible
> 못 들었어요 --> "I couldn't/didn't hear you"
> 못 갈 거예요 --> "I won't be able to go"

### ~(으)ㄹ 수 없다
- This implies that something is actually impossible 
    - If the context is specific, impossible within that context

> 인간은 날 수 없어요 --> Humans cannot fly

# 곳 vs 데
[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/25jk1v/difference_in_usage_of_%EA%B3%B3_vs_%EB%8D%B0_for_place/chii09c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
### (1)
 곳 is speficially the dependent noun of location. It can refer to both the physical location or the metaphorical location. Whenever 곳 is used, you could replace it with 장소 and it will work just as well.

 데 is more general in the usage. It can refer to the location, characteristic, situation, etc. If it is used as the dependent noun of locaton, 장소 or 곳 replacement will be just as fine. If it's not, then it won't work.

**Examples: (The weather is nice where I live)**
 >- 내가 사는 곳은 날씨가 좋아요.
 >- 내가 사는 데는 날씨가 좋아요.

 Both are great because they can both refer to a specific location

**Here's another example though: (Do you have any medicine for a headache?)**
 >- 머리아픈 데(에) 먹는 약 있어요? (circumstance)
 >- 머리 아픈 곳에 먹는 약 있어요? (doesn't work)

 In this case, 데 is not the dependent noun of location, therefore the 곳 replacement won't work.

### (2)
 곳 can be dependent on demonstrative or adjectival modifiers (of any tense). 데 can ONLY be dependent on adjectival modifiers (of any tense).
 **Example: (This is the city where I live)**
 >- 이 곳은 내가 사는 도시입니다. (O)
 >- 이 데는 내가 사는 도시입니다. (X)
 >
 *이, 저, 그 are all demonstrative determiners and cannot be used with 데.*
 >- 여기가 내가 사는 곳입니다. (O)
 >- 여기가 내가 사는 데입니다. (O)

 In this instance, 곳 and 데 are both dependent on 사는, an adjectival modifier of present tense. They are interchangeable.
